# django-gestion

## Background

This project was made to help a small family business manage their sales. 
This was also done with the intention to learn Django. 

Since i had done some basic django tutorial in the past, i decided to do a different thing and use Django Rest Framework, so i could just focus on the backend at first, and then using some react to work on the frontend, which was a challenge since im mostly a backend developer.


## Disclaimer

I am not a frontend designer and a chunk of styling was only possible due to ChatGPT. I opted to spend most of my time with the logic and even refactored multiple times to improve the project structure, rather than becoming super proficient with css.

## Stack

 - Backend: Django Rest Framework
 - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) 
 - Frontend: ReactJS
 - Styling: Material UI + custom CSS

## Functionality

This application uses a basic model of everything that the target business is right now doing with pen and paper:
- Customers
- Products
- Sales

What you can do:
- CRUD functionality for customers, products, sales.
- Advanced pricing for the products.
- Tables in which you can sort or filter the data.
- Additional pages to help display info in a practical way (such as the sales vouchers, price lists).
- I did not convince the user to stop printing from excel(they save paper in the way they do it), so i added the functionality to copy and paste sales vouchers into excel/sheets.
